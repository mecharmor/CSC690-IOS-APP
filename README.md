## What's Hunter Helper?

Hunter Helper is an IOS app designed for hunters who need an offline app to keep records of hunting paths and notes regarding scopes and the adjustments needed when hunting at various distances and terrains.

- Use **Core Location to track hunting path** (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation)
- User can **Add a weapon to their dashboard and modify attributes**
- User can **Start Hunt** so their traveled path will be saved so they can playback the trail they took


## Functionality
- 1. Ability to keep track of your hunt along with which firearm used.
- 2. History of firearms used.
- 3. Lists the stats of your firearms (i.e bullet caliber, brand, type of gun, model of gun, attachments, special functionalities of the gun etc.) 
- 4. Notepad for storing notes, and records.
